# ML-for-Retail-Sales-Forecasting
In this project we have built a neural network model for retail sales forecasting for a pharmacy and compare its results with the results of regression algorithms. Our aim is to develop the most accurate predictions for future sales with the current sales dataset. From the analysis and implementations of neural network model and regression algorithms, the MLP neural network model provides the best results in comparison with other regression model algorithms. MLP neural network model provides least mean squared error 0.08395. Thus, the MLP neural network model provides highest accuracy of sales forecasting by using weekly sales data of the pharmacies dataset.
